           Bertha Harper, the owner and founder of Bertha's Deluxe Chocolates, has always had an interest in nutrition and sustainability.
           Becoming a vegetarian at 11,  Bertha has spent more than half her life on the lookout for high quality products 
           that fit her dietary restrictions and allergies. With a big sweet tooth and little to choose from, Bertha decided to take on the task
           of creating guilt-free chocolates! Now Bertha's Deluxe Chocolates has products all over San Francisco and is growing more and more every day.
